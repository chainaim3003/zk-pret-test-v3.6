# GLEIF Verification Fix

## Problem Identified
The GLEIF verification test was appearing to complete successfully but not showing actual verification results. The issue was in `GLEIFLocalMultiVerifierUtils.ts` - it was exporting a function but had no main execution block to run when called from the command line.

## Root Cause
- The script `local-deploy-verify-GLEIF.js` calls `GLEIFLocalMultiVerifierUtils.js` directly
- However, `GLEIFLocalMultiVerifierUtils.js` only exported a function without executing it
- This resulted in the process completing with exit code 0 (success) but doing no actual work

## Fix Applied
Added a main execution block to `GLEIFLocalMultiVerifierUtils.ts` that:

1. **Command Line Argument Handling**: Reads the company name from command line arguments
2. **Verification Execution**: Calls the existing `getGLEIFLocalMultiVerifierUtils` function
3. **Detailed Results Display**: Shows comprehensive verification results including:
   - Company name and LEI
   - Compliance score and status
   - Timestamp of verification
   - ZK proof generation status
   - Error handling with detailed error messages

4. **Summary Statistics**: Displays:
   - Total companies processed
   - Success/failure counts
   - Number of ZK proofs generated

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript changes
2. Test with: `npm run test:local-complete-GLEIF "SREE PALANI ANDAVAR AGROS PRIVATE LIMITED"`

## Expected Output After Fix
Instead of just seeing success messages, you should now see:
- Detailed GLEIF data fetching logs
- Compliance analysis results
- ZK proof generation status
- Comprehensive verification results with LEI, compliance scores, etc.
- Clear success/failure status for each company

## File Modified
- `src/tests/with-sign/local/GLEIFLocalMultiVerifierUtils.ts`

The fix ensures that when the verification script is called, it actually performs the verification and displays meaningful results instead of just completing silently.
